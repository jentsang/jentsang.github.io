# Impact & Results
Our team was awarded Second Place for our ability to translate these statistical findings into actionable business recommendations.

# The Challenge
- Analyze whether the current promotions work, and what other business strategies can we recommend to promote reusable cup usage.
- Trying to strike the balance between environmental protection and profit generation.

# What we did
- **Data set cleaning & joining**: calculated product profit from items, merged it to the sales dataset, added cup profit to finally get total profit per transaction

- **EDA**: visualize financial and environmental performance before/after Nov 2023

- **Statistical analysis**: z-test

- **Simple modeling**: Logistic Regression
