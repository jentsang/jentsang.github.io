My name is Jennifer Tsang, nice to meet you! I hold a Bachelor’s in Biomedical Engineering and am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at the University of British Columbia. My interests lie in biostatistics, data-driven healthcare, and bridging the gap between engineering and data science.

Hobbies

Outside of academics, I enjoy both creative and active pursuits. I love baking and crocheting, which let me express creativity and attention to detail. I also stay active through badminton, ultimate frisbee, and hiking, which keep me energized and connected with friends.

A highlight of my baking journey is being selected as one of the 10 bakers on Season 9 of [The Great Canadian Baking Show](https://www.cbc.ca/television/the-great-canadian-baking-show/jennifer-tsang-gcbs-baker-bio-1.7624553)! :cake::maple_leaf:
