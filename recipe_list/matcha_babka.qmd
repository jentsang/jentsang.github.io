![Matcha babka wreath for my Christmas brunch.](/img/recipes/matcha_babka.jpg)

This Christmas, I decided to depart from the traditional rich chocolate babka and experiment with something more vibrant. Inspired by [Sherry’s Chocolate Babka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS2SGVVri68), this version swaps out cocoa for matcha, resulting in a beautifully braided wreath with a striking green interior and a sophisticated, earthy sweetness.

### Instructions

1. In a standmixer bowl with dough attachment, add in <span class="text-primary-emphasis">whole eggs, egg yolk, milk, water, bread flour, all purpose flour, salt, milk powder, sugar</span> and <span class="text-primary-emphasis">matcha power</span>. Mix on <span class="text-primary-emphasis">low speed (speed 2)</span> until dough forms.
2. Add in <span class="text-primary-emphasis">instant yeast</span>. Mix until combined.
3. Chill dough in fridge for <span class="text-warning">20 minutes.</span> 
4. Mix on <span class="text-primary-emphasis">medium speed (speed 4)</span> for <span class="text-warning">~5 minutes</span>; look for stretchy dough but not window pane yet.
5. Add in <span class="text-primary-emphasis">soften butter</span>, mix on <span class="text-primary-emphasis">low speed (speed 2)</span> until butter is incorporated. Then mix on <span class="text-primary-emphasis">medium speed (speed 4)</span> until <span class="text-primary-emphasis">window pane consistency</span> is reached <span class="text-warning">(~5-10 minutes)</span>.
6. Put dough into a greased bowl; let it proof until <span class="text-primary-emphasis">doubled in size <span class="text-warning">(~1 hour)</span>.
7. Degas dough and roll out to a <span class="text-success">21x15 inch (53x38cm) rectangle</span>.
8. Spread <span class="text-primary-emphasis">matcha filling</span> onto the dough evenly. 
9. Roll up the dough into a log, fairly tightly. 
10. Cut log down the middle, and braid to form into a <span class="text-primary-emphasis">wreath shape</span>. 
11. Proof until double in size <span class="text-warning">(~45-60 minutes)</span>. Brush on egg wash before baking.
12. Preheat the oven to <span class="text-success">350°F / 180°C</span>, bake for <span class="text-warning">25-30 minutes</span> on the middle to lower rack. After about 10 minutes, when the surface is coloured, <span class="text-primary-emphasis">cover with foil</span> to prevent the top from being burnt.

#### Matcha Filling 
1. Add all ingredients into a bowl and melt over a <span class="text-primary-emphasis">double broiler</span> until paste forms, set aside. Warm it up if paste is too thick and chill in the fridge if the paste is too thin. You want a spreadable consistency.
