This project explores text-based classification using the City of Vancouver’s Street Food Vending dataset.\nI engineered a binary target from vendor descriptions and trained multiple models, including Decision Trees and Logistic Regression, to identify hot dog vendors based solely on their business names. After rigorous cross-validation, a tuned Naïve Bayes classifier emerged as the top performer with 79% accuracy. The project highlights the challenges of imbalanced datasets and the nuances of classifying minority target classes in urban data.\nView Repository\n\n\n\n Back to top"
